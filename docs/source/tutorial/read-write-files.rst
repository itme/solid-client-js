Read/Write Files
================

Even if the core Solid data model is **structured** data (see
:doc:`/tutorial/read-write-data`), a Solid Pod can also act as a regular
general-purpose data store. Besides your profile document, your friend
list and the likes, your Pod can also store your photos, PDFs and any
other type of file. Note that the :doc:`access restrictions
</tutorial/manage-access-control-list>` apply to files the same way
they apply to any other :term:`Resource`.

Like anything else in your Pod, each file is a resource with a distinct
URL, which may or may not contain a hint such as a ``.jpg`` extension
for a photo. You'll find that the functions available to read and write
files to/from your Pod are very close to the browser's ``fetch``: files
are represented as typed `Blobs
<https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Blob>`_, and the result of
the functions is returned as a `Response
<https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response>`_.

Read a File
===========

Reading a file is just a matter of fetching the content available at a certain URL. You get a `Response` in return, which contains
the fetched file as a blob. It is then up to you to decode it appropriately.

   :language: typescript
   :start-after: BEGIN-EXAMPLE-READ-FILE
   :end-before: END-EXAMPLE-READ-FILE

Write a File
============

There are two approaches to writing files:

1. you know exactly at which URL your file should be saved (potentially overwriting any data that sat there previously).
2. you know what [Container](../glossary#container) should be the parent of your file, like saving it into a folder.

Write a file directly at a URL
------------------------------

With this approach, if the request succeeds, you know exactly what the URL of your file is.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/write-file.js
   :language: typescript
   :start-after: BEGIN-EXAMPLE-WRITE-FILE
   :end-before: END-EXAMPLE-WRITE-FILE

Save a file into a parent resource
----------------------------------

With this approach, you kindly ask the server to come up with a name for your file, potentially using a `slug` if you
provide one. Note that there is no guarantee about how the server will use the slug, if at all. In any case, if the slug
you provide matches a file that already exists under the same target resource, the server will create a new name for your
file so that no content is overwritten.

This means that you don't control the final name of your file though. To keep track of the name the server gave to your
file, you'll have extract it from the return value, as shown in the code snippet below:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/save-file.js
   :language: typescript
   :start-after: BEGIN-EXAMPLE-SAVE-FILE
   :end-before: END-EXAMPLE-SAVE-FILE

Delete a File
=============

Deleting a file is also a simple operation: you just erase the content available at a certain URL.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/delete-file.js
   :language: typescript
   :start-after: BEGIN-EXAMPLE-DELETE-FILE
   :end-before: END-EXAMPLE-DELETE-FILE
