# @inrupt/solid-client

# Installation

```bash
npm install @inrupt/solid-client solid-auth-client
```

# Usage

See https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-js/docs/

# Browser support

solid-client uses relatively modern JavaScript features that will work in all commonly-used browsers, except Internet Explorer. If you need support for Internet Explorer, it is recommended to pass it through a tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io), and to add polyfills for e.g. `Set`, `Promise`, `Headers`, `Array.prototype.includes` and `String.prototype.endsWith`.
