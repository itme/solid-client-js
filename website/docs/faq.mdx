### What are these properties/functions with an `internal_` prefix?

There is some metadata and functionality that solid-client exposes or attaches to the data structures it
returns, that are for internal use and/or allows your editor to warn you when you are passing the
wrong type of data to its functions. These are _not_ intended for direct access, and they might
change without warning in newer versions.

For each of these pieces of data, solid-client exposes non-internal functions such as
[`getContentType`](./api/modules/_resource_resource_.md#getcontenttype) to access them and that
_are_ part of the officially supported API, and hence can be relied upon not to break without
warning.
