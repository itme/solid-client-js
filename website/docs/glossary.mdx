This is a list of terms commonly used in this documentation and library.

For questions around the concepts and terminology specific to Solid, more info can be found on the
[project's website](https://solidproject.org/faqs).

### Access

See also the tutorial [Managing Access](./tutorials/managing-access.md).

#### Access Modes

The types of access that have been granted by an [ACL](#acl): [Read](#read-access),
[Append](#append-access), [Write](#write-access) and/or [Control](#control-access).

##### Read Access

When an [ACL](#acl) grants Read access, the grantee is allowed to view the contents of the
applicable [Resource](#resource).

##### Append Access

When an [ACL](#acl) grants Append access, the grantee is allowed to add data to the applicable
[Resource](#resource), but it does not grant them access to remove any.

##### Write Access

When an [ACL](#acl) grants Write access, the grantee is allowed to change the contents of the
applicable [Resource](#resource). Granting Write access automatically also grants
[Append](#append-access) access.

##### Control Access

When an [ACL](#acl) grants Control access, the grantee is allowed to see and change who has access
to the applicable [Resource](#resource).

#### ACL

An **Access Control List**. For an overview of how they work in Solid, see
[Managing Access](./tutorials/managing-access.md).

#### Agent

A term with which we typically mean a person, but which could also refer to e.g. bots.

#### Default access

[Access](#access) rules that apply not to the [Container](#container) Resource directly, but recursively to its
children, their children if applicable, so on and so forth.

#### Fallback ACL

If a Resource does not have [an ACL that applies to it directly](#resource-acl), the fallback ACL is
the ACL of the Container closest to that Resource that has its own Resource ACL. Only the [default
access](#default-access) rules in the fallback ACL apply.

#### Resource ACL

The [ACL](#acl) that applies to a given Resource. If none exists, the [fallback ACL](#fallback-acl)
applies.

### Data

See also the tutorial [Working with Data](./tutorials/working-with-data.md).

#### Container

_Technically_, a special type of [Resource](#resource). A Container contains Resources, or other
Containers, much like folders on your file system.

For example, given a Resource at <NoWrap>`https://cleopatra.solid.community/profile/card`</NoWrap>,
both <NoWrap>`https://cleopatra.solid.community/profile/`</NoWrap>
and <NoWrap>`https://cleopatra.solid.community/`</NoWrap> are Containers.

#### LitDataset

A [`LitDataset`](./api/modules/_interfaces_.md#litdataset) represents all the [Things](#thing) that are
(to be) stored in a specific [Resource](#resource).

#### Property

Like JavaScript objects, [Thing](#thing)s have _properties_. Unlike JavaScript, these properties are
not identified by just any strings, but, like so many things in Solid, by URLs. This ensures that
whichever app uses these URLs intends them to mean the same, rather than e.g. one app understanding
`name` to be just the family name, whereas the other uses it for one's full name.

#### Resource

The thing that's sent to you when you type a URL into a web browser.

#### Thing

A [`Thing`](./api/modules/_interfaces_.md#thing) is a set of data about a single thing. For example, a
Thing about yours truly could include the fact that my name is "Vincent".

#### WebID

A URL that identifies a user or other [Agent](#agent). The [Resource](#resource) found at this URL
can provide more information about this Agent, such as the location of their data.
