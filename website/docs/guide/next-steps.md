Now that you know the general principles behind solid-client, it's time to do some actual work. Here are some suggested next steps.

## Learn about common tasks

By far the most common task you will do with solid-client is reading and writing data, so a recommended starting point is the tutorial [Working with Data](../tutorials/working-with-data.md).

## Read the API documentation

After you have a high-level overview of how to work with solid-client, but want to know what functionality is available or what parameters you need to pass to a given function, the [API documentation](../api/index.md) is a good place to go.

## Connect with the community

If you have questions about how to work with solid-client or just want to share what you're working on, the [Solid forum](https://forum.solidproject.org) is a good place to meet the rest of the community.
