:::warning

The Solid specification has not settled yet, and access management specifically is expected to
change in the future.

As a result, the API's described here are expected to change in future non-major releases.

## Access Control in Solid

In Solid, who has what access to a [Resource](../glossary.mdx#resource) is defined in an Access Control
List ([ACL](../glossary.mdx#acl)). These may be defined in separate Resources, so if you want to be able
to access the ACLs for a Resource in addition to the Resource itself, you'll have to explicitly
fetch them using
[`getSolidDatasetWithAcl`](../api/modules/_resource_soliddataset_.md#getsoliddatasetwithacl) —
but be aware that this may result in several extra HTTP requests being sent.

The possible [Access Modes](../glossary.mdx#access-modes) that can be granted are
[Read](../glossary.mdx#read-access), [Append](../glossary.mdx#append-access),
[Write](../glossary.mdx#write-access) and [Control](../glossary.mdx#control-access),

:::note A note about access to ACLs

A Resource's or Container's ACL is only accessible to your app if the following are true:

1. The authenticated user must have authorised your app to manage access on their behalf. At the
   time of writing, the most common Solid server has that permission unchecked by default, i.e.
   users will need to have actively given your app this permission.
2. The authenticated user should have [Control access](../glossary.mdx#control-access) to the
   applicable Resource or Container.

:::

## Finding out who has access

Access can be granted to individual [agents](../glossary.mdx#agent), to groups, or even to everyone.
We currently only support reading what access has been granted to individual agents specifically.

### Fetching access information

Getting access information when fetching a resource may result in an additional request to the server. To avoid
unecessary requests, the API makes it explicit when you get access information along your resource: `getSolidDatasetWithAcl`. The returned value includes both the Resource data (e.g. your profile or friend list), the `ResourceInfo`,
and the ACL containing the associated access information.

### Reading public access

Given a [SolidDataset](../glossary.mdx#soliddataset) that has an ACL attached, you can check what access
everyone has, regardless of whether they are authenticated or not. You can do so using
[`getPublicAccess`](../api/modules/_acl_class_.md#getpublicaccess):

```typescript
import { getSolidDatasetWithAcl, getPublicAccess } from "@inrupt/solid-client";

const webId = "https://example.com/profile#webid";
const solidDatasetWithAcl = await getSolidDatasetWithAcl("https://example.com");
const publicAccess = getPublicAccess(solidDatasetWithAcl);

// => an object like
//    { read: true, append: false, write: false, control: true }
//    or null if the ACL is not accessible to the current user.
```

### Reading agent access

Given a [SolidDataset](../glossary.mdx#soliddataset) that has an ACL attached, you can check what access a
specific agent has been granted, or get all agents for which access has been explicitly granted.

To do the former, use
[`getAgentAccess`](../api/modules/_acl_agent_.md#getagentaccess):

```typescript
import { getSolidDatasetWithAcl, getAgentAccess } from "@inrupt/solid-client";

const webId = "https://example.com/profile#webid";
const solidDatasetWithAcl = await getSolidDatasetWithAcl("https://example.com");
const agentAccess = getAgentAccess(solidDatasetWithAcl, webId);

// => an object like
//    { read: true, append: false, write: false, control: true }
//    or null if the ACL is not accessible to the current user.
```

To get all agents to whom access was granted, use
[`getAgentAccessAll`](../api/modules/_acl_agent_.md#getagentaccessall):

```typescript
import {
  getSolidDatasetWithAcl,
  getAgentAccessAll,
} from "@inrupt/solid-client";

const solidDatasetWithAcl = await getSolidDatasetWithAcl("https://example.com");
const accessByAgent = getAgentAccessAll(solidDatasetWithAcl);

// => an object like
//    {
//      "https://example.com/profile#webid":
//        { read: true, append: false, write: false, control: true },
//      "https://example.com/other-profile#webid":
//        { read: true, append: false, write: false, control: false },
//    }
```

## Changing who has access

To be able to _change_ who has access to a specific Resource, you will need to know a little bit
more about how Access Control works in Solid:

### Two types of ACL

A Resource _can_ have an ACL that applies to just that Resource. However, if no such ACL exists, the
Pod server will [fall back](../glossary.mdx#fallback-acl) to the ACL of its
[Container](../glossary.mdx#container) — or its Container's Container's, or its Container's
Container's Container's, etc.

Thus, an ACL can control both access to a specific Resource or Container directly, and provide
_default_ access rules: those that apply to the _children_ of the applicable Container when it
serves as their fallback ACL. Note that the Container's _Resource_ access rules will _not_ apply to
its children.

### Modifying the ACL

To modify access to a Resource, you will need to obtain its ACL. Assuming you have fetched the
Resource using
[`getSolidDatasetWithAcl`](../api/modules/_resource_soliddataset_.md#getsoliddatasetwithacl),
you can call
[`getResourceACL`](../api/modules/_acl_acl_.md#getresourceacl) to obtain its ACL — or
`null` if it does not exist.

If it exists, that's great, and you can move on to the next section. You can create a new ACL if it
does not exist yet, but be aware that doing so will result in overriding any access currently granted
to the Resource via the default access rules of its fallback ACL, as described in the previous
section.

A new empty ACL can be initialised using
[`createAcl`](api/modules/_acl_acl_.md#createacl), given that the current user has
the rights to do so (i.e. [Control](../glossary.mdx#control-access) access on the target Resource).
However, keep in mind that this ACL will override any ACL that currently applies to it. The
consequence is that if you do not give someone Control access before saving it to the Pod, nobody
will ever be able to modify the ACL ever again, which might result in losing access to some data in
the Pod.

If the fallback ACL is available to the current user, it is possible to copy the currently
applicable rules to a newly-initialised ACL; but be aware that future updates to the fallback ACL
will not be reflected in the new ACL.

The general process of changing access to a Resource is as follows:

```typescript
import {
  getSolidDatasetWithAcl,
  hasResourceAcl,
  hasFallbackAcl,
  hasAccessibleAcl,
  createAcl,
  createAclFromFallbackAcl,
  getResourceAcl,
  setAgentResourceAccess,
  saveAclFor,
} from "@inrupt/solid-client";

// Fetch the SolidDataset and its associated ACLs, if available:
const solidDatasetWithAcl = await getSolidDatasetWithAcl("https://example.com");

// Obtain the SolidDataset's own ACL, if available,
// or initialise a new one, if possible:
let resourceAcl;
if (!hasResourceAcl(solidDatasetWithAcl)) {
  if (!hasAccessibleAcl(solidDatasetWithAcl)) {
    throw new Error(
      "The current user does not have permission to change access rights to this Resource."
    );
  }
  if (!hasFallbackAcl(solidDatasetWithAcl)) {
    throw new Error(
      "The current user does not have permission to see who currently has access to this Resource."
    );
    // Alternatively, initialise a new empty ACL as follows,
    // but be aware that if you do not give someone Control access,
    // **nobody will ever be able to change Access permissions in the future**:
    // resourceAcl = createAcl(solidDatasetWithAcl);
  }
  resourceAcl = createAclFromFallbackAcl(solidDatasetWithAcl);
} else {
  resourceAcl = getResourceAcl(solidDatasetWithAcl);
}

// Give someone Control access to the given Resource:
const updatedAcl = setAgentResourceAccess(
  resourceAcl,
  "https://some.pod/profile#webId",
  { read: false, append: false, write: false, control: true }
);

// Now save the ACL:
await saveAclFor(solidDatasetWithAcl, updatedAcl);
```

### Setting public access

:::note

solid-client currently does not support setting public access.

:::

### Setting agent access

Given a Resource's ACL obtained as [described previously](#modifying-the-acl), you can grant Access
Modes to an Agent for the Resource itself, and/or to its children if the Resource is a Container.

To do the former, use
[`setAgentResourceAccess`](../api/modules/_acl_agent_.md#setagentresourceaccess):

```typescript
import {
  setAgentResourceAccess,
} from "@inrupt/solid-client";

const resourceAcl = /* Obtained previously as described above: */;
const webId = "https://example.com/profile#webid";

const updatedAcl = setAgentResourceAccess(
  resourceAcl,
  webId,
  { read: true, append: true, write: false, control: false },
);

// `updatedAcl` can now be saved back to the Pod using `saveAclFor()`.
```

To grant Access Modes to the Agent for the Resource's children, use
[`setAgentDefaultAccess`](../api/modules/_acl_agent_.md#setagentdefaultaccess):

```typescript
import {
  setAgentDefaultAccess,
} from "@inrupt/solid-client";

const resourceAcl = /* Obtained previously as described above: */;
const webId = "https://example.com/profile#webid";

const updatedAcl = setAgentDefaultAccess(
  resourceAcl,
  webId,
  { read: true, append: true, write: false, control: false },
);

// `updatedAcl` can now be saved back to the Pod
// using `saveAclFor()`.
```
